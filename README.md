threex.cloudgaming
===================

It is a 
[threex](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex/) module 
for 
[three.js](http://threejs.org)
which provide an 2-cents cloudgaming solution for webgl games.
The implementation is simple. The whole thing is 300lines at the moment.
It is easy to use too. 
I did a minigame to test it. It worked ok at 20fps
over wifi. 
Performances may fit your use case or not.
Bench it and see.

Principles
==========
Idea cheap cloud gaming for webgl: from [here](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JeromeEtienne/posts/9EvYkc7YBgm)

* On server side you got a browser web running the game
* On this server you take regular screenshot .toDataUrl
* You send them to the player device... mobile phone, tablette whatever.
* Thus the player can see webgl rendering on any device.
* The player use touch screen as inputs
* They are then sent to the server which send them back to the browser.
* So we got the whole loop. The browser receives inputs from the player.
* And the player sees what is displayed in the browser.

This is actual cloud gaming! All that with a simple node.js server to write and some js code.
Performances are left as an exercice to the reader :)

\[[view source](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.cloudgaming/blob/master/examples/bothsinglepage.html)\] :
It shows an example of remote renderer and a remote controller on the same page.
This is is usefull to debug
